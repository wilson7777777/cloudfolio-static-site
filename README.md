# Cloudfolio Static Site

A fully automated DevOps pipeline for deploying a static website to AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN, built with Vite and managed with Terraform.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions
- AWS S3 hosting for static files
- CloudFront CDN for caching and global delivery
- Terraform infrastructure as code to provision AWS resources
- Handling large binaries safely in Git using .gitignore and git-filter-repo

## Features

- Automated site build and deployment
- S3 bucket sync with deletion of old files
- CloudFront invalidation after each deployment
- Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- Secure management of AWS credentials with GitHub Secrets

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vite (JavaScript / HTML / CSS)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Cloud: AWS S3, CloudFront
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wilson7777777/cloudfolio-static-site.git
cd cloudfolio-static-site

2. Install dependencies
npm install

3. Build the project to generate the ./dist folder
npm run build

4. Configure GitHub Secrets for deployment
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION
- S3_BUCKET_NAME
- CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID
- DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME (if needed)
- DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN (if needed)

5. Push to GitHub to trigger GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

## Deployment Process

- GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds the site with Vite
- Syncs the ./dist folder to the S3 bucket
- Invalidates CloudFront cache to serve updated content
- Ensures old files are deleted and only current files remain

## Folder Structure

- dist/ -> built static site (generated by npm run build)
- infra/ -> Terraform configuration for AWS resources
- .github/workflows/ -> GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- src/ -> source code of the site
- .gitignore -> ignores Terraform providers, state, and node_modules

## Notes

- Terraform binaries and state files are ignored in Git using .gitignore
- Large files were removed from Git history using git-filter-repo
- AWS credentials must be securely stored in GitHub Secrets
- Always build the project before running deployment commands
